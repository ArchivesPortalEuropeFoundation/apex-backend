terms.use.part.three=1. All European institutions responsible for archival material can become content providers and use the portal for the publication of information on their holdings and their institutions, once registered by their Country Manager. The Country Manager is registered as such by APEF and grants other institutions access to the dashboard on their request. It is also possible for these institutions to delegate a Country Manager or another authorised person to act on their behalf, provided agreement on this exists between the institutions and the specific Country Manager or other authorised person, subject to notification to APEF. This delegation has to be signed at the end of this agreement. Registered content providers obtain access to the dashboard and the tools provided by APEF for the preparation of the data.<br/>2. The registration to the dashboard and the use of the dashboard must be made by an authorised person acting as a representative of or on behalf of the content provider. This person will not transfer the registration information to non-authorised persons or non-authorised third parties.<br/>3. The content provider or an authorised person can upload, convert, validate, publish, update, or delete content manually (via HTTP and FTP) or automatically (via OAI-PMH) whenever desired. APEF makes this necessary technical interface available through which the content provider has full and immediate control over his own data or the data that he manages on behalf of other institutions that he represents. The result of the deletion operation will become effective on the web presentation after the delay necessary for data processing. Any data that the content provider wants to have deleted will not be included in back-up operations and will be completely erased from the servers.<br/>4. The content provider or an authorised person can use the functionality made available by APEF to automatically transfer data to third parties, such as Europeana. APEF has no responsibility for the data delivered to third parties. Content providers also wishing to make their data available via Europeana will need to sign the special agreements provided for this purpose by Europeana and are recommended to act accordingly with regard to other third parties having separate agreements. The content provider can also stop the order of transferring data with the technical functionality made available by APEF. APEF has no responsibility whatsoever for data that already have been transferred by the content provider using the dashboard.<br/>5. No data transferred to the Archives Portal Europe can be re-used without the explicit authorisation of the content provider. Each registered content provider is responsible for the legal accessibility of and the rights to re-use the data uploaded by himself to the Archives Portal Europe and optionally transferred to third parties using the technical functionality provided for this in the dashboard.
